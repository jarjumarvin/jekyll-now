title: An introduction to Artificial Intelligence through Number-Guessing

Over the past couple of months, I have been quite fascinated by **machine learning [ML]** and **artificial intelligence [AI]**. So much so that I am now even considering going into AI / ML research after I finish my bachelors degree in computer science. 
That being said there's still quite a lot of time until then so let's move on to today's project.

# What is a Neural Network?

> In neuroscience, a biological neural network is a series of interconnected neurons whose activation defines a recognizable linear pathway.The interface through which neurons interact with their neighbors usually consists of several axon terminals connected via synapses to dendrites on other neurons.

# The Structure of a Neuron

The biological Neuron is a cell that receives, processes and transmits information. It can generally be broken down into four major parts:

* **Dendrites** receive signals from another neuron
* The **cell body** processes all incoming signals and fires a signal once a certain threshold value is reached
* The **axon** guides the signal towards the dendrites of other neurons
* **Synapses** connect two neurons and transmits the signal from neuron #1 to neuron #2

These connections between two neurons are **weighed**. The strength of a signal transmitted through any synapse is dependent on the [**synaptic potential**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Synaptic_potential). Such a weighed connection can either decrease the transmitted signals strenght, or increase it.

# What is an Artificial Neural Network?

> Artificial Neural Networks [ANNs] or connectionist systems are computing systems inspired by the biological neural networks that constitute animal brains.

Artificial Neural Networks **[ANN]** are systems derived from the human nervous systems. Their basic structure represents that of the nerve cells (neurons) which are present in the nervous systems of the human (animal) body.

The artificial neuron is closely modeled after the biological ones present in our nervous systems:

* The **inputs** represent the signals the neuron receives from other nearby neurons
* **Weights** determine the strenght of an individual signal
* These signals are then **summed** to calculate the total input
* An **activation function** calculates the neurons **output** from the input

## The Perceptron

The most basic form of an artificial neuron calculates it's output using an activation function called the **Heaviside step function**.

</p>

$$				
	H[n] :=  \left\{\begin{matrix} 0, & n<0, \\ 1, & n>0 \\ \end{matrix}\right.
$$

This functions value is either zero for negative arguments and one for positive arguments. A neuron with an activation function like this is called a **perceptron**

In general, a simple perceptron can be written as a mathematical function with a vector as an input:

$$
	y(\vec{x}, \vec{\omega}) =\varphi\left(\sum\limits_{i=0}^n\omega_ix_i\right)
$$
where $\vec{x}$ and $\vec{omega}$ are the inputs and weights respectively
$$
	\vec{x} = \left[\begin{matrix}x_0\\x_1\\\vdots\\x_n\end{matrix}\right] \;\;\;\;\;\;\; \vec{\omega} = \left[\begin{matrix}\omega_0\\\omega_1\\\vdots\\\omega_n\end{matrix}\right] 
$$

Now you might think, a single perceptron consumes a lot of inputs, but only outputs one of two values - either 0 or 1. Yet there is a class of problems that even a single perceptron can solve:

</p>

Imagine two sets of points, divided by a line. Such a set is **linearly seperable**. As such, a single perceptron can learn where that line is and correctly predict which set any given point P(x, y) belongs to.
