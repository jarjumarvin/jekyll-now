title: An introduction to Artificial Intelligence through Number-Guessing

Over the past couple of months, I have been quite fascinated by **machine learning [ML]** and **artificial intelligence [AI]**. So much so that I am now even considering going into AI / ML research after I finish my bachelors degree in computer science. 
That being said there's still quite a lot of time until then so let's move on to today's project.

# What is a Neural Network?

> In neuroscience, a biological neural network is a series of interconnected neurons whose activation defines a recognizable linear pathway.The interface through which neurons interact with their neighbors usually consists of several axon terminals connected via synapses to dendrites on other neurons.

# The Structure of a Neuron

The biological Neuron is a cell that receives, processes and transmits information. It can generally be broken down into four major parts:

* **Dendrites** receive signals from another neuron
* The **cell body** processes all incoming signals and fires a signal once a certain threshold value is reached
* The **axon** guides the signal towards the dendrites of other neurons
* **Synapses** connect two neurons and transmits the signal from neuron #1 to neuron #2

These connections between two neurons are **weighed**. The strength of a signal transmitted through any synapse is dependent on the [**synaptic potential**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Synaptic_potential). Such a weighed connection can either decrease the transmitted signals strenght, or increase it.

# What is an Artificial Neural Network?

> Artificial Neural Networks [ANNs] or connectionist systems are computing systems inspired by the biological neural networks that constitute animal brains.

Artificial Neural Networks **[ANN]** are systems derived from the human nervous systems. Their basic structure represents that of the nerve cells (neurons) which are present in the nervous systems of the human (animal) body.

# The Artificial Neuron

The artificial neuron is closely modeled after the biological ones present in our nervous systems:

* The **inputs** represent the signals the neuron receives from other nearby neurons
* **Weights** determine the strenght of an individual signal
* These signals are then **summed** to calculate the total input
* An **activation function** calculates the neurons **output** from the input

## The Perceptron

The most basic form of an artificial neuron uses an activation function called the **Heaviside step function**.

$$				
	H[n] :=  \left\{\begin{matrix} 0, & n<0, \\ 1, & n>0 \\ \end{matrix}\right.
$$

This functions value is either zero for negative arguments and one for positive arguments.
