Over the past couple of months, I have been quite fascinated by **machine learning (ML)** and **artificial intelligence (AI)**. So much so that I am now even considering going into AI / ML research after I finish my bachelors. That being said there's still quite a lot of time until then so let's move on to today's project.

# What **IS** a Neural Network?

> Artificial Neural Networks (ANNs) or connectionist systems are computing systems inspired by the biological neural networks that constitute animal brains.

Artificial Neural Networks **[ANN]** are systems derived from the human nervous systems. Their basic structure represents that of the nerve cells (neurons) which are present in the nervous systems of the human (animal) body.
