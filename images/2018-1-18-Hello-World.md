Hello World!
I never really thought about making a blog site, but I recently discovered [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com/) and [Jekyll Now](https://github.com/barryclark/jekyll-now), so I decided to create one!

This will be a devblog, so the content will mostly revolve around coding, my projects and random shenanigans I discover while working on them.
I have never blogged before, so bear with me!

Anyways, hope you enjoy this blog, and see you soon!
